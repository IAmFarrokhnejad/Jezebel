Coding my own Alexa




The application incorporates various functionalities, such as speech recognition, speech synthesis (text-to-speech), and integration with external APIs to perform tasks like playing songs. The project incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the tkinter library. The GUI includes buttons to start and stop listening for user commands. The user input and Jezibel's responses are displayed in separate labels within the GUI.



Important notes:
- Make sure you have the required libraries installed before running the code.
- Preferably use a microphone for convenience.
