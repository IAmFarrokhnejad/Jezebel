The application incorporates various functionalities, such as speech recognition, speech synthesis (text-to-speech), and integration with external APIs(with primary one being an older version of ChatGPT by OpenAI) to perform tasks like playing songs. The project incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the tkinter library. The GUI includes buttons to start and stop listening for user commands. The user input and Jezibel's responses are displayed in separate labels within the GUI.
